  <h2>What is Mutual Aid?</h2>
  <p>
    Mutual aid is the collaborative effort to support members of your community in times of hardship. It’s about coming together to make sure people’s needs are met. As humans, we must cooperate to survive. Mutual aid isn’t just charity, because it’s not just financial; it’s about support and solidarity, and it is essential to the success of this movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    We strongly encourage you to get involved in mutual aid, give when you can, and support your community.
