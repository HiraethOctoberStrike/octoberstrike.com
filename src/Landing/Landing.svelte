    You seem to have stumbled on the new website for the October Resistance!
  </h5>
  <p>
    Whether you are a member of the working class, an activist, a social media connoisseur, or just a concerned citizen, the members at Labor Movement X welcome you with open arms. No matter where youâ€™re from, we hope that this statement reaches you in good conscience.
  </p>
  <h6>Why are we called Labor Movement X?</h6>
  <p>
    Originally, this event was marketed exclusively as a strike. While this movement is largely centered around a general economic strike, we want to be sure that the world knows that this is not just a strike. This is a nationwide campaign that will fight for the rights of all working class people, by whatever means necessary. There are multiple ways to participate in this movement from: striking, to boycotting, picketing, participating in sit-ins, peaceful protesting, outreach, and many more. Because of this, we decided to change the name of the event to the October Resistance, and the name of the movement as a whole to Labor Movement X. X for 10. 10th month, 10 days, 10 demands.
