There’s a lot of paperwork and legal steps needed to go ‘on strike’ including reporting a workplace complaint to the National Labor Relations Board.',

So even though Union Organizing is a protected activity, your employer may find or invent another reason to terminate you.

Can you pre-purchase shelf stable foods or find a community pantry nearby? Can you ask your doctor for a longer prescription refill for the short term?
