    snippet: 'Wage hasn’t gone up since 2009 and hasn’t been in sync with worker productivity since 1969. There is NO state in the US where a full-time, minimum wage job can cover the cost of living. At the beginning of COVID-19, we saw the rise of praise for \"essential workers.\" Out of those that were deemed essential, almost half of them make under $15/hr.  If minimum wage kept pace with worker productivity, it would be around $24/hr.'

    snippet: 'The United States is the only country in the Western world with no federally mandated parental leave. Low wages and skyrocketing child-care costs have caused many working class parents to struggle to support their families. Studies show there are numerous health benefits for the children of parents who have paid leave, and it is time for paid parental leave to become available to all working class people.'

Labor Movement X is demanding that the wealthiest individuals and corporations are held accountable for the taxes that are owed to the general public.'

    snippet: 'The privatized healthcare system in the United States has prevented many working class families from receiving affordable care. This system is more expensive and less accessible to the average American worker than universal healthcare. (Medicare for all would save $2 trillion over a 10-year period) Thousands of preventable deaths occur every year due to the current healthcare system, and it must be changed. (Medicare for all would save 680,000 lives over a 10-year period).'

These events will only become more frequent and more severe in the coming years.  This is why climate change poses an existential threat to the worker, if not humanity as a whole, and must be combated for the good of all.'

By identifying and addressing these issues, employers can create a safe and welcoming environment for ALL working class people.'

    title: 'A Workplace Based On Skill',
    snippet: 'Despite it being 2021, the median salary between men and women, a 2021 report from Payscale reports that women earn 82 cents for every dollar men make. In addition to this, transgender and transitioning individuals may face wage and opportunity gaps regardless of their gender identity.
