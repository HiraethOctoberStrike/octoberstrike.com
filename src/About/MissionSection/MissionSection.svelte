  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We aim to organize our collective power - our voices, our labor, our dollars - to take concrete, sweeping action needed to save this country from continued collapse. After a year and a half of a pandemic and on the brink of environmental devastation we can no longer afford to be patient. To ask for change and wait for those with power and influence to save us all. Weâ€™re coming together to demand progress now.
